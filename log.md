# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Section 13, video 137 - 190 on Typescript - The Complete Developers Guide on Udemy

**Thoughts:**
Typescript continues to blow me away with both the ease of development and the complexity that it entails. The design patterns used in the course
are also some of the best that I have personally experienced and make much more sense than code I have personally written. While I was taught DRY
and have done my best to adhere to those principles, adhering to it at such a deep level has been difficult as each of my functions were focused
on one thing, and as soon as that was done I would simply write another function. Often times I would use a function for multiple things in one
file but entire classes

**Today's Progress**: Section 13, video 191 - 208 on Typescript - The Complete Developers Guide on Udemy

**Thoughts:**
Finishing the web framework and learning that some of the elements have been inspired by Backbone and Marionette was interesting. I attempted to do the bonus objective of
completing the CollectionView class but stumbled on a few parts along the way, and ended up going partially into the next video for inspiration. In the end I got most
of the code correct but I did fumble with the HTML implementation itself. Overall, I've learned a lot from building the project in section 13 and am very excited
to move on to the Express + Typescript integration portion next!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
